\title{Parity rule 2 (PR2) plot}
\usage{
PR2.plot.group(df.list, fasta.df, fold4 = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df.list}{a list returned from read.virus function}

\item{fold4}{if TRUE only 4-fold amino acids will be included in the analysis.}

\item{fasta.df}{a DNAStringSet object contain only one data frame.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.
}
\description{
Make a Parity rule 2 (PR2) plot, where the AT-bias [A3/(A3 +T3)] at the third codon position of the four-codon amino acids of entire genes is the ordinate and the GC-bias [G3/(G3 +C3)] is the abscissa. The center of the plot, where both coordinates are 0.5, is where A = U and G = C (PR2), with no bias between the influence of the mutation and selection rates.
